def simulate():
    '''Main simulation loop. It handles the sim loop and the game over screen.
    
    The simulation loop is the main loop that handles the game logic. It is
    responsible for handling the car's control system, the obstacles, the
    sensors, and the game over screen. It also handles the game's pause
    functionality and the game's end.
    
    You can modify the simulation loop by declaring different constants in the 
    section below. For references of what you can change, see the constants in
    elements/environment.py as well as the functions in elements/environment.py, 
    and constructor values for car class and monitor methods.
